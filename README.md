# Machine Learning
Project Goals:
•	Understanding the dataset.
•	Analyzing the problem.
•	Selecting the perfect tools that help us analyze and visualize the dataset.
•	Performing data wrangling for data cleaning like outliers.
•	Feature selection and scaling.
•	Choosing an algorithm.
•	Coding to find the accuracy and prediction.
•	Writing a report on my findings.

# Background Information:
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in united states but collapsed into bankruptcy due to       corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data to executives.

In this project, using the data available and with the help of scikit-learn and machine learning methodologies I will investigate the person of interest who may have committed the fraud.

Number of features:  8
Number of people in the dataset: 146
Number of poi in the dataset: 18
Number of person who is not poi: 128
